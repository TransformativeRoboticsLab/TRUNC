# State variables

(Kinematic model)
model_home: lengths based on our model
model_comp: compressed lengths based on our model
comp_delta: compression delta

all other delta the model predicts should be deltas that are applied from the compressed state 

(Actual robot)
home: cable lengths for arm to be at minimal tension
comp: compressed lengths for the arm (home + comp_delta)
